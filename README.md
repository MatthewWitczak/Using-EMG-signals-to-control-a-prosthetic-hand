# Using-EMG-signals-to-control-a-prosthetic-hand
This project demonstrates how electromyographic (EMG) signals can be used to control a prosthetic hand. The software acquires raw EMG data from surface electrodes, processes it in real time using digital filters, and translates the extracted muscle activity into control commands for servo motors.
